# HBV Notes

## Clinical Virology book

- Enveloped 3.2-kb double-stranded DNA
virus and prototypical member of the family Hepadnaviridae.

- Classified into ten major genotypes (A to J)
based on nucleotide (nt) diversity of 8% or more over the
entire genome (6â€“10). 
These genotypes show distinct geo-graphical distributions

- As genotype designation is
now based on the entire genomic sequence, it is a more
reliable classification than the earlier serological subtype
nomenclature (adw, adr, ayw, and ayn) used previously,
which was based on the immunoreactivity of particular
antibodies to a limited number of amino acids in the enve-
lope protein.

-  Particular HBV genotypes have unique inser-
tions or deletions. For example, HBV genotype A varies from
