# HBV Notes

## Clinical Virology book

### Introduction

- Enveloped 3.2-kb double-stranded DNA
virus and prototypical member of the family Hepadnaviridae.

- Classified into ten major genotypes (A to J)
based on nucleotide (nt) diversity of 8% or more over the
entire genome (6–10). 
These genotypes show distinct geo-graphical distributions

- As genotype designation is
now based on the entire genomic sequence, it is a more
reliable classification than the earlier serological subtype
nomenclature (adw, adr, ayw, and ayn) used previously,
which was based on the immunoreactivity of particular
antibodies to a limited number of amino acids in the enve-
lope protein.

-  Particular HBV genotypes have unique inser-
tions or deletions. For example, HBV genotype A varies from

- Important pathogenic and therapeutic differences appear
to exist among HBV genotypes, including significant differences in intra- and extracellular expression of viral DNA and antigens.
- Genotype C is associated with more severe liver disease than is genotype B in Taiwan, while
in India, genotype D is associated with more severe liver
disease than is genotype A.

### Virus Structure: Virion and Subviral Particles

- Three types of virus-associated particles are typically present in the blood of HBV-infected persons
    1. The complete infectious virus is spherical with a diameter of 42 nm.
        - The outer shell, or envelope, is formed by hepatitis B surface antigen (__HBsAg__)
        - The inner shell is the viral nucleocapsid or hepatitis B core antigen (__HBcAg__)
- The sera of viremic patients also contain large numbers of two types of noninfectious particles: 
    2. Spherical particles
    2. Filamentous forms
- Both types of subviral particles are composed of HBsAg and are not infectious.

### Genome Organization and Viral Proteins

- The genome of HBV is a circular, partially double-stranded relaxed circular (21) (RC) DNA molecule. 
- The two linear DNA strands are held in a circular configuration by a 226-
base-pair (bp) cohesive overlap between the 5¢ ends of the two DNA strands that contain 11-nt direct repeats called __DR1__ and __DR2__
- All known complete HBV genomes are gapped and circular.
- Genome length varies between 3181 and 3221 bases depending on the genotype.
- The minus strand is not a closed circle and has a gap between its 3¢ and
5¢ ends. 
- The viral polymerase is covalently bound to the 5¢ end of the minus strand. 
The 5¢ end of the plus strand contains an 18-base-long oligoribonucleotide, which is
capped in the same manner as mRNA. 
- The 3¢ end of the plus strand is not at a fixed position, so most viral genomes contain a single-stranded gap region of variable length ranging from 20 to 80% of genomic length.
- This can be filled in by the endogenous viral DNA polymerase.
- The minus strand encodes __four__ open reading frames (ORF), the longest of which encodes the viral polymerase (__Pol__ ORF)
- The envelope ORF (Pre-S1, Pre-S2,and S) is located within the Pol ORF while the precore/core
(Pre-C/C) and the X ORFs overlap partially with it. 
- The ORFs overlap in a __frameshifted__ manner and so the virus strand is read one and one-half times. 
- The transcriptional template of the virus is the __covalently closed circular__ (__CCC__)
DNA, which exists in the cell nucleus as a viral minichromosome. 
- The CCC template encodes  __four major RNA species__ (kilobases):
    1. 3.k
    2. 2.4
    3. 2.1. 
    4. 0.7
- The enhancer II/basal core, large surface antigen (Pre-S1), major __surface__ antigen (S), and __enhancer__ I/X gene promoters direct the expression of these four transcripts,
respectively.

### Pol ORF

- The Pol gene is the longest ORF, spanning almost 80% of the
genome and overlapping the other three ORFs. 

- The Pol protein is translated from pregenomic RNA. 

- The 834 to 845 codons found in the Pol ORF have sequence
homology to reverse transcriptases and most parts of
the ORF are essential for viral replication. 

- The 90-kDa product of the Pol ORF is a multifunctional protein that has at least four domains. 

- The N-terminal domain encodes the terminal protein that is covalently linked to the
5¢ end of the minus strand of virion DNA. 

- This part of Pol ORF is necessary for priming of minus-strand synthesis. 

- An intervening domain with no specific recognized function is referred to as the spacer or tether region. 

- The third domain encodes the RNA- and DNA-dependent DNA polymerase activities; that is, the reverse transcriptase. 

- The C-terminal domain encodes ribonuclease (RNase) H activity that cleaves the RNA in the RNA-DNA hybrids during reverse transcription.

- The terminal protein’s role in priming reverse transcription includes the provision of the substrate tyrosine at amino acid 63 of the HBV Pol for the formation of the covalent
bond between the enzyme and the first nucleotide (G) of the minus-strand DNA. 

- The DNA polymerase domain contains the sequence motif tyrosine-methionine-aspartate-
aspartate (YMDD), which is essential for reverse transcriptase activity. T

- The RNase H domain, besides degrading the RNA template, also plays a role in viral RNA packaging, in optimizing priming of minus-strand DNA synthesis and in elongation of the minus-strand viral DNA.


- The Pol encodes at least two __T-cell epitopes__ within its catalytic domains at amino acid residues 107 to 115 and 227 to 235. 

- Changes in these epitopes have been related to successful interferon-a therapy and viral clearance during acute infection

### Pre-C/C ORF

The Pre-C/C ORF encodes the core protein P21, which is the major polypeptide of the nucleocapsid and expresses the __HBcAg__. 

- The HBc protein is 183, 185, or 195 amino acids long, depending on the genotype of the virus

- ORF C is preceded by a short, upstream, in-phase ORF called the Pre-core region from which the soluble hepatitis B early antigen (__HBeAg__) is made.

### HBc Protein

- The HBc protein has two distinct domains with amino acid residues 1 to 144 required for the assembly of the 32-nm nucleocapsid.

- The arginine-rich, C-terminal residues from around 140 onward form a protamine-like domain that mediates nucleic acid binding and is involved in viral encapsidation and DNA replication. 

- This arginine-rich region contains four clusters and includes a potential nuclear
localization sequence. 

- The core protein contains many hydrophilic and charged amino acids, and, when expressed, it
becomes phosphorylated. 

- Phosphorylation of serine 170 to 172, between arginine clusters 3 and 4, appears to block
nucleic acid binding and may negatively regulate nuclear localization of the core protein (8). 

The HBc protein is also translated from pregenomic RNA and carries the hepatitis B core antigen (HBcAg) epitopes, which are cross-reactive with the HBeAg epitopes

- HBcAg may play an active role in regulating viral transcription. 

- In the immune clearance phase, HBcAg becomes predominantly cytoplasmic, in conjunction with decreasingviral load. 

- HBcAg becomes undetectable in the immune control phase.

- Multiple studies demonstrate the multifunctional nature of HBV proteins.

### HBe Protein

- The HBeAg is essentially a soluble secretory form of the HBc protein and is considered an accessory protein of the virus. 

- The Pre-C sequence is upstream of core, and translation initiating from the Precore initiation codon produces the Pre-core protein that contains the entire Core protein
sequence plus an additional 29 amino acids at the N-terminal end (P25). 

- The Precore protein is translated from the Pre-C/C mRNA. 

- The first 19 amino acids of the Precore protein form a secretion signal that allows the translocation of the Precore protein into the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). 

- These 19 amino acids are cleaved by a host-cell signal peptidase, leaving the Precore
protein derivative P22. 

- The P22 is then secreted through the ER and Golgi apparatus and further modified by C-terminal cleavage of up to 34 amino acids, resulting in the secretion of
a heterogeneous population of proteins of approximately 17 kDa, serologically defined as HBeAg 

- _HBe protein differs in almost all aspects from HBc protein_, although the primary sequences of these two molecules are almost identical. 

- The P25 HBe protein also expresses a nuclear transport signal. 

- Thus, HBe proteins of variable length are found in practically all compartments of the cell, as well as being secreted.

- The HBe protein is essential for establishing persistent infection. 

- Mutants of HBV without a functional Pre-C sequence and HBe protein are found commonly during
chronic infection. 

- The HBeAg is not essential for HBV replication but is absolutely
required for the establishment of persistent infection 

- The HBeAg is an important accessory protein in the life cycle of HBV. 

- Two major groups of mutations have been identified, which result
in reduced or blocked HBeAg expression.

- The HBeAg has two B cell epitopes, one of which is linear (HBe1) and the other (HBe2) conformational. 

- The HBe1 epitope is found at core amino acid positions 76 to 89, and
the HBe2 epitope is at positions 130 to 138


- Check out the __epsilon (E) stem-loop structure of HBV__

- This is a highly conserved structure within the 10 genotypes of HBV

### Pre-S/S ORF

- The HBsAg contains small (SHBs), medium (MHBs), and large (LHBs) proteins, all of which exist in two forms differing in the extent of glycosylation. 

- N-linked glycosylation and glucosidase processing are necessary for
virion, but not subviral particle, secretion (8). 


### SHBs

- The SHBs domain is 226 amino acids long and is the most abundant protein of all three HBV-associated particles.

- The SHBs is found in a glycosylated and a nonglycosylated form. 

- It contains a high number of cysteine residues that cross-link with each other, forming a conformational loopthat is the major antigenic determinant of HBsAg, the “a”
determinant or antigenic loop (__AGL__). 

- The AGL is responsible for _initiating viral entry_ to target hepatocytes by
initially interacting with cell-surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPG), which likely explains its presence on all known HBsAg isolates in a highly conserved fashion.

### MHBs

- The MHBs Pre-S2 domain is a minor component of the virion or HBs particle

- Consists of the S and a 55-amino-acid N-terminal extension. 

- It is not essential for virus assembly and release. 

### LHBs

- The LHBs contains a further N-terminal extension to the M protein of 108 or 119 amino aci(depending on the subtype/genotype)

- In contrast to MHBs, the LHBs is essential for infection and viral morphogenesis, as the Pre-S1 region encodes the NTCP-binding domain

- The LHBs has important antigenic sites for both B and T cells that appear to play critical roles in recovery from viral infection or protection from infection

### ORF

- The X ORF encodes a 154-amino-acid polypeptide (__HBx__) of 17 kDa. 

- This second accessory protein of HBV is conserved in a similar form across all the mammalian
hepadnaviruses. 

- The expression of full-length HBx protein is dispensable for virus replication in vitro but is a criticalcomponent of the infectivity process in vivo. 

- HBx behaves as a _transcriptional transactivator_ of a number of viral and cellular gene promoters through direct interaction with transcription factors

- HBx also increases the transcription of the cccDNA template by modifying its _epigenetic regulation_. 

- Epigenetic modification controls how tightly wound chromatin is to
structural histone proteins. 

- More tightly wound chromatin is not translated, whereas the converse is true; histone acety-
lation loosens chromatin but methylation tightens it. 

- HBx recruits histone acetyltransferase and deacetylase enzymes in a fashion designed to prevent hypoacetylation.

- On the other hand, HBx in vitro inhibits protein arginine methyl-transferase 1 (PRMT1), which functions to increase histone methylation.

- Another important target of HBx is the _ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS)_, which is a conserved cellular pathway involved in protein ubiquitination and proteolysis

- The HBx protein also has a role as a cofactor in HBV-mediated carcinogenesis.
