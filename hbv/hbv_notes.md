# HBV Notes

## Clinical Virology book

### Introduction

- Enveloped 3.2-kb double-stranded DNA
virus and prototypical member of the family Hepadnaviridae.

- Classified into ten major genotypes (A to J)
based on nucleotide (nt) diversity of 8% or more over the
entire genome (6–10). 
These genotypes show distinct geo-graphical distributions

- As genotype designation is
now based on the entire genomic sequence, it is a more
reliable classification than the earlier serological subtype
nomenclature (adw, adr, ayw, and ayn) used previously,
which was based on the immunoreactivity of particular
antibodies to a limited number of amino acids in the enve-
lope protein.

-  Particular HBV genotypes have unique inser-
tions or deletions. For example, HBV genotype A varies from

- Important pathogenic and therapeutic differences appear
to exist among HBV genotypes, including significant differences in intra- and extracellular expression of viral DNA and antigens.
- Genotype C is associated with more severe liver disease than is genotype B in Taiwan, while
in India, genotype D is associated with more severe liver
disease than is genotype A.

### Virus Structure: Virion and Subviral Particles

- Three types of virus-associated particles are typically present in the blood of HBV-infected persons
    1. The complete infectious virus is spherical with a diameter of 42 nm.
        - The outer shell, or envelope, is formed by hepatitis B surface antigen (__HBsAg__)
        - The inner shell is the viral nucleocapsid or hepatitis B core antigen (__HBcAg__)
- The sera of viremic patients also contain large numbers of two types of noninfectious particles: 
    2. Spherical particles
    2. Filamentous forms
- Both types of subviral particles are composed of HBsAg and are not infectious.

### Genome Organization and Viral Proteins

- The genome of HBV is a circular, partially double-stranded relaxed circular (21) (RC) DNA molecule. 
- The two linear DNA strands are held in a circular configuration by a 226-
base-pair (bp) cohesive overlap between the 5¢ ends of the two DNA strands that contain 11-nt direct repeats called __DR1__ and __DR2__
- All known complete HBV genomes are gapped and circular.
- Genome length varies between 3181 and 3221 bases depending on the genotype.
- The minus strand is not a closed circle and has a gap between its 3¢ and
5¢ ends. 
- The viral polymerase is covalently bound to the 5¢ end of the minus strand. 
The 5¢ end of the plus strand contains an 18-base-long oligoribonucleotide, which is
capped in the same manner as mRNA. 
- The 3¢ end of the plus strand is not at a fixed position, so most viral genomes contain a single-stranded gap region of variable length ranging from 20 to 80% of genomic length.
- This can be filled in by the endogenous viral DNA polymerase.
- The minus strand encodes __four__ open reading frames (ORF), the longest of which encodes the viral polymerase (__Pol__ ORF)
- The envelope ORF (Pre-S1, Pre-S2,and S) is located within the Pol ORF while the precore/core
(Pre-C/C) and the X ORFs overlap partially with it. 
- The ORFs overlap in a __frameshifted__ manner and so the virus strand is read one and one-half times. 
- The transcriptional template of the virus is the __covalently closed circular__ (__CCC__)
DNA, which exists in the cell nucleus as a viral minichromosome. 
- The CCC template encodes  __four major RNA species__ (kilobases):
    1. 3.k
    2. 2.4
    3. 2.1. 
    4. 0.7
- The enhancer II/basal core, large surface antigen (Pre-S1), major __surface__ antigen (S), and __enhancer__ I/X gene promoters direct the expression of these four transcripts,
respectively.
