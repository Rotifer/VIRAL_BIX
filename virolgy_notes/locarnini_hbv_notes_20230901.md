Entevavir and Tenofovir -both RT inhibitors- are the standard of care

Heterogeneous forms of HBV particles in the blood

Multiple cycles of entry and re-entry

Dominant quasi-species pool

Splice variants and full-length RNA

Classic life cuvle

Entry -> CCC -> RT

RNA is packaged and secreted

What is the role of these in the infection cycle?

Entry process

Two major receptors

Major: NTCP (High affinity)
Minor: Heparin Sulphate Glycoprotein receptor (low affinity)


NTCP interacting inhibitor: Myrcludex B

Cytosolic Transport of Nucleocapsids

A. Primary infection 

Mature nucleocapsids transported via importin alpha/beta whilst nucleoporin 153 delivers nucleocapsids to nuclear basket where the uncoat at nuclear pore

Genomic RC (Relaxed Circular) DNA enters the nucleoplasm with Pol covalently attached and is then converted to PF-RC DNA
HBV species, e.g. HBx mRNA released and translated.

B. Persistent infection

Intracellular conversion pathway provides low level recyvling of nucleocapsids-replication complexes from hepatocyte cytoplasm
Multiple rounds of re-infection replenish key intermediates

TARGET: NUCLEOCAPSID DISASSEMBLY WITH CpAM compounds: BLOCK cccDNA GENERATION

Key Step 1: Conversion of RC DNA into cccDNA

Host enzymes perform the following:

Removal of RT
Removal of r (what is r?)
Ligation of (-) DNA
Completion of (+) DNA
Removal of capped RNA
Ligation of (+) DNA

Host RNA polymerase II transcribes cccDNA into Pregenomic HBV RNA (pgRNA)
Reverse transcription of the pgRNA to HBV Minus (-) DNA
HBV DNA Polymerase creates the HBV RC Genomic DNA

HBV cccDNA is a Minichromosome

It has two forms depending on its chromatin state: Closed or Open
Closed form has repressive nucleosomal spacing and is transcriptionally inactive
The cccDNA minichromosome is different from host cell chromatin: no H1 histones in the cccDNA minichromosome

The Levrero structure: The core antigen and the X protein are key components of the minichromosome
Also includes transcription factors.

In the closed form you have deacetylation (HDAC) and methylation enzymes are key
HBx blocks methylation complex
HBcAg binds HBV DNA *CpG Island II)
HBx knock-out results in transcriptional arrest of the mini Chromosome (MC)

HBx Contributes to Establish an Active cccDNA Chromatin State
It recruits key enzymes (demethylators) - reduces methylation status
Attracts acetylation enzymes

HBx Promotes Degradation of the Smc5/6 Complex to Prevent Silencing of HBV cccDNA

HBx Inhibitors: To Silence Minichromosomes

HBcAg and Transcription: Preferential Binding of HBcAgto HBV Minichromosome

Interaction of APOBEC 3A/3B, HBc and cccDNA
APOBEC3B is activated and recognises HBc and MC leading to selective degradation of the viral MC via deamination and uracil excision.

Targeting HBV Nucleocapsids

Novel classes of capsid inhibitors based on the 3D structure of HBc

How Can cccDNA be Cleared? An Immunological perspective

IFN-gamma + TNF-alpha can "cure"" cells of cccDNA

How Can cccDNA be Cleared: A Virological Perspective

Three approaches:

Topisomerases to directly purge all pre-existing cccDNA (topoisomers)
Permanently silence cccDNA (condensed chromatin) transcription
cccDNA targeting - small molecule antivirals

Direct cccDNA Destruction: Molecular Based Therapies

Cleave cccDNA molecules via cccDNA sequence-specific endonuclease using:
Zinc-finger nucleases
Trasncription activator-like effector nuleases (TALENS)
CRISPR/Cas9 technology

The RNA Sensor RIG-I Dually Functions as an Innate Sensor and Direct Antiviral Factor for Hepatitis B

RIG-I senses HBV genotype A, B and C for the induction of type I and III IFNs
The 5'-e region of HBV pgRNA is a key element of RIG-I mediated recognition
RIG-I counteracts the interaction of HBV polymerase with pgRNA to suppress viral replication
Type III IFNs are predominantly induced in human hepatocytes during HBV infection

Inarigivir (SB9200) - IFN inducer
3 log reduction in HBV RNA

HBeAg negative patients do much better that HBeAg positive - not clear why

Mechanism of RNA Interference (RNAi)

1-2 log reduction in HBsAg but hit toxicity problems due to delievery apparatus

Novel findings: Predominant liver HBV DNA differs in HBeAg neg and HBeAg pos chimps

Targeting the HBV Nucleocapsid

The HBV core protein is a gate keeper of replication 
It maintains the cccDNA.
Forms a dimer

HBsAg Targeting Strategies

HBsAg clearance an endpoint of therapy
Decline in HBsAg levels may restore the antiviral activity of exhausted T cells
Several strategies in evaluation
RNAi for gene silencing
Nucleic acid polymers (NAPs): HBsAg release
HBs antibodies

Immune Regukation by HBsAg

Enormous immunological burden on the chronically infected patient due to enormous amount in plasma
First generation recombinant vaccine was made from patient HBsAg
HBsAg secreted in vast excess over virions (>10^3 fold)
Circulate in blood 100-400 ug/mL (1% of total serum protein)
Unique conformational structure (* cysteines and eight prolines)
Associated with increased risk of HCC
Plays a key role in HBV persistence
Suppresses both innate (TLR-2, TLR-9 and IFN-alpha) as well as adaptive (mDc) responses to infection

Putting It All Together

Potent NA to prevent viral spread and cccDNA re-amplification
cccDNA inhibitor that is safe and selective to reduce or silence cccDNA
HBV antigen inhibitors to block/inhibit the HBV life-cycle (entry, cell-spread, capsid assembly, HBx, HBeAg, HBsAg)
Immune activators to activate specific antiviral immune responses or relieve repression/exhaustion of the system

The medium-term aim for the field is to achieve "functional cure" - HBsAg serconversion off treatment
