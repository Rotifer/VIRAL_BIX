### Introduction

A possible association between post-transfusion hepatitis and hepatocellular carcinoma was notes in the mid-1950s.

The Austria antigen was discovered in the 19960s and shown to be associated with post-transfusion chronic hepatitis. Hepatitis A virus (HAV) does not cause chronic hepatitis therefore the Australia antigen was a useful screening marker.

The Australia antigen was subsequently discivered to be the HBV surface antigen ( __HBsAg__ ) and could be visualised in the serum using EM.

The actual virion which is much rarer in the serum than HbSAg. The vior became known as __ the Dane particle__.

The HBsAg assay also confirmed the suspected association between chronic HBV infection and HCC in humans.

HBsAg, purified from HBV carriers, became the first vaccine to prevent HBV infection (mid-70s).

Collectively, the HBV family of viruses is now known as the hepadnaviridae, with two genera, orthohepadnaviruses (infecting mammals), of which HBV is the prototype, and avihepadnavirus (infecting birds), of which DHBV is the prototype
